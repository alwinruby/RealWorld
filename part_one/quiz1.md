In the kitchen a "make omelette" function decreases the stress on your memory by compressing many steps into one idea. In the coding world, what is the advantage of the "make_omelette" function?

        allows efficient reuse of code

Every function must include an output value.

        FALSE

One advantage of functionalizing your code is making efficient reuse of the code. What's another major advantage?

        a frequently used process can be modified by changing code in just one place

What's the central difference between a parameter and an argument?

        A parameter is the variable used for input values in a function, while an argument is the specific input value passed to the function.

This Python code tries to create a function with two parameters:  "def clean_house(tool, tool):"  What is wrong with the code?

        The two parameters should be uniquely named.

Consider the following function: "def clean_house(*tool):"

How many arguments can be passed to this function?

        an unlimited number of arguments

All parameters and variables defined with a function are considered local variables .

        TRUE

Functions search for variables in the following order:

        local variable, then global variable
